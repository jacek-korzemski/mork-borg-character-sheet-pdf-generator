# Mork Borg random Player generators

Mork Borg is an RPG system, that kills players faster, than Mr. Morawiecki kills Polish economy. That's why, me and my friends need a tool for super fast Player generating. My friend Wookie as the MG is creating backend, and I as a player created this frontend app for generatig nice PDF to cut up to 3 players at once from one paper sheet.

## Just temporary data

Right now, I'm still waiting for backend, so I've created some dummy data to use for testing purposes. The data is not valid with the Mork Borg official guide.

## Production ready

### But still ugly...

Core machics works for now here `http://metalmusic.pl/morg-borg/` - characters are generated, and PDF with 4 characters are downloadable. But... The configuration panel is super ugly right now, I'll try to make it nice, and maybe even mobile-friendnly.

# BUT FIRST!

Current build is ready for me, to start learning unit and integration testing soon 🤖👷‍♀️👷‍♂️
